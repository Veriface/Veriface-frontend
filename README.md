## Product use
- The frontend interface allows anyone to quickly see whether an account has been blacklisted
or whitelisted by the veriface DAO
- Allows users to create blacklist proposals to the Vefi(Veriface Dao) for a particular account


## Description 
If you're not implementing account security  checks via a smart contract you can equally implement them manually using our website. Input any account's address and get feedback on the address health within the ecosystem. A blacklisted Address will typically show the reason for the blacklist and the transactions that were examined before it was blacklisted. White-listed addresses would have to pass our personal identification to ensure that they are to be trusted.
